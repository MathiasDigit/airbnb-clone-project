# About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

# üë• Team Roles
*   **Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.**

*   **Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.**

*   **DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.**

*   **QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.**

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
*   **Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.**
*   **Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.**
*   **PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.**
*   **GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.**
*   **Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.**
*   **Redis: Used for caching and session management.**
*   **Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.**
*   **CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.**

# üìùDatabase Design
Database entities include the following.
*   **User:**
*   **Property:**
*   **Bookings:**
*   **Payments:**
*   **Review:**

Relationships Between Entities
*   **Users can view available properties through the property endpoints.**

*   **Users can book properties using the booking endpoints.**

*   **Payments are made for bookings via the payment endpoint, linking a user to a property through a transaction.**

*   **Users can leave reviews for properties through the review endpoint, typically after completing a booking.**

# üß© Feature Breakdown
*  **User Management**
Enables users to create an account, log in securely, and edit personal information. This system manages user sessions and profile settings.

*   **Property Management**
Allows hosts to publish new property listings, modify existing ones, or delete them as needed. It supports full control over listing content and availability.

*   **Booking System**
Facilitates reservation of properties, with options to edit or cancel bookings. It includes date selection, availability checks, and tracking of check-in/check-out.

*   **Payment Processing**
Manages financial transactions for confirmed bookings. Ensures that payments are processed safely and linked correctly to the associated reservation.

*   **Property Reviews**
Users can share feedback on properties they've stayed in. Reviews can be submitted, edited, or deleted, contributing to transparency and quality control.

## API Security

Securing our backend APIs is essential for safeguarding user data, maintaining application integrity, and ensuring a trustworthy user experience. We will implement the following key security measures:

*   **Authentication (JWT):**  Verifies the identity of users or applications accessing the API using JSON Web Tokens. This ensures only legitimate users can access protected resources and their data.

*   **Authorization (RBAC):** Controls access to resources based on user roles using Role-Based Access Control. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality.

*   **Rate Limiting:** Limits the number of requests a user/application can make within a timeframe. This protects against abuse and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, ensuring API availability.

*   **Input Validation:** Validates all data received by the API. This prevents injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS) by ensuring data conforms to expected formats and constraints.

*   **HTTPS:** Enforces HTTPS for all communication between client and server. This encrypts data in transit, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.

*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Configures CORS to restrict which domains can access the API. This prevents unauthorized websites from making requests, mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risks.

These measures are crucial for protecting user data, securing payments, maintaining application integrity, and ensuring API availability and reliability.

These security measures are crucial for:

*   **Protecting User Data:** Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive user information such as passwords, personal details, and financial data.
*   **Securing Payments:** Protecting payment information and preventing fraudulent transactions.
*   **Maintaining Application Integrity:** Preventing unauthorized modifications to the application's data and functionality.
*   **Ensuring Availability:** Protecting the API from denial-of-service attacks and ensuring that it remains available to legitimate users.

# üöÄ CI/CD
CI (Continuous Integration) is the process of automatically testing and validating code whenever changes are made. This helps catch bugs early, ensures code quality, and supports smooth collaboration across the development team.

CD (Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment) takes over after successful tests.

*   **With Continuous Delivery, code is automatically prepared for production but requires manual approval before release.**

*   **With Continuous Deployment, code is released to production automatically without manual steps.**

Implementing CI/CD enhances development speed, reduces deployment errors, and ensures a more reliable software delivery process.

Tools Used for CI/CD
*   **GitHub Actions ‚Äì Automates build, test, and deployment workflows.**

*   **Travis CI ‚Äì Provides continuous testing and integration.**

*   **GitLab CI/CD ‚Äì Integrated pipeline system for GitLab repositories.**

*   **AWS CodePipeline ‚Äì Automates deployments using AWS services.**

*   **CircleCI ‚Äì Fast and scalable CI/CD for modern applications.**
